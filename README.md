# timew-extensions

This repository holds the Timewarrior extensions I use.

## Extensions

- My modified version of `totals.py`, with these changes:
  - Sort tags by time, reversed (it was alphabetical).
  - Sum total time as clock time, instead of the sum of tags (it would sum every tag, duplicating periods with multiple tags).
  - Add separate total for productive tasks. Set `custom.unproductive_tags` on Timewarrior to use it.
